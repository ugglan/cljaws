# cljaws

cljaws is a relatively thin wrapper for the typica and jets3t AWS
libraries. In its current state it is very sparse and incomplete,
functionality will be added on a "need it!"-basis.

My aim is to have something that makes it easy and fun (for me!) to
use all of the Amazon Web Services in a consistent and somewhat
clojuresque manner.

I have no ambitions to completely hide the innards of the parent
libraries because sometimes I might want to work with the
Java-objects.

The API will very likely keep changing for some time.


## Installation

cljaws uses the leiningen build tool, [get it](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 
if you don't have it!


1. Clone the repo

2. Fetch dependencies - `lein deps`

3. Copy the aws.properties.template file to aws.properties and
   edit it to contain your own credentials.

As an alternative to creating aws.properties you can use
`(with-aws-keys ID KEY ....)` but I don't recommended it.

Optional 4. Run `lein test` Note: as AWS doesn't guarantee how long it takes
for modifications to be available, some test may fail occasionally.


## Usage 

I'm trying to keep the test-cases pretty complete, but they might not
be very readable so here is some example usage:


    ; enqueue the names of all my s3-buckets as a message in queue "bucketlist"
    (use '(cljaws core s3 sqs))
    
    (with-aws :sqs
      (with-queue :bucketlist
        (doseq [bucket-name (with-s3 (list-buckets))]
    	   (enqueue bucket-name))))
    
    
    (use '(cljaws sdb helpers))
    
    ; create sdb domain
    (with-aws :sdb (create-domain :workspace))
    
    ; dequeue messages sent above and add each one as a row in the sdb-domain
    (with-aws :sdb :sqs
      (with-queue :bucketlist 
    	(with-domain :workspace
    	  (doseq [msg (take-while (comp not false?) (repeatedly #(dequeue 5)))]
    		 (add-attributes msg {:type "testing bucket"})))))
    
    ; select all rows and attibutes from domain
    (with-aws :sdb (select "* from workspace"))
    
    
    ; Upload an image and a string to mybucket. Then make the string
    ; publicly available on http://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/foo.txt
    (use 'cljaws.s3)
    (with-aws :s3
      (with-bucket :mybucket 
        (put-object "secretfile.jpg" (java.io.File. "cute.jpg"))
        (put-object "foo.txt" "hello world!")
        (grant "foo.txt" {:all-users :read})))
