# cljaws


cljaws is a relatively thin wrapper for the typica and jets3t AWS
libraries. In it's current state it is very sparse and incomplete,
functionality will be added on a "need it!"-basis.

My aim is to have something that is easy to use and feels somewhat
clojuresque, while having no ambitions to completely hide the innards
of the parent libraries.

The API will very likely change, at the moment it might be a bit
binding/with-happy. We'll see.



## Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. Fetch dependencies - "lein deps"

3. Create a file "aws.properties" containing your AWS id and
secret key in normal property file form:

id=XXXXXXXXXXX
key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

As an alternative to creating aws.properties you can use
(with-aws-keys ID KEY ....) but I don't recommended it.


## Usage 

Example usage:

; enqueue the names of all my s3-bucket as a message in queue "bucketlist"
(use '(cljaws core s3 sqs))

(with-aws 
  (with-sqs-queue "bucketlist" 
    (doseq [bucket-name (with-s3 (list-buckets))]
	   (enqueue bucket-name))))


(use '(cljaws sdb helpers))

; create sdb domain
(with-aws (with-sdb (create-domain :workspace)))

; dequeue messages sent above and add each one as a row in the sdb-domain
(with-aws 
  (with-sqs-queue "bucketlist" 
    (with-sdb
	(with-domain :workspace
	  (doseq [msg (take-while (comp not false?) (repeatedly #(dequeue 5)))]
		 (add-attributes msg {:type "testing bucket"}))))))

;select all rows and attibutes from domain
(with-aws (with-sdb (select "* from workspace")))
