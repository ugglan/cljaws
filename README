# cljaws

cljaws is a relatively thin wrapper for the typica and jets3t AWS
libraries. In its current state it is very sparse and incomplete,
functionality will be added on a "need it!"-basis.

My aim is to have something that makes it easy and fun (for me!) to
use all of the Amazon Web Services in a consistent and somewhat
clojuresque manner.

I have no ambitions to completely hide the innards of the parent
libraries because sometimes I might want to work with the
Java-objects.

The API will very likely change, at the moment it might be a bit
binding/with-happy and it's a bit inconsistent in when it will return
a Java-object and when it will wrap it in (bean ..).




## Installation

cljaws uses the leiningen build tool, get it at
http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen if you don't have it!


1. Clone the repo

2. Fetch dependencies - "lein deps"

3. Create a file "aws.properties" containing your AWS id and
secret key in normal property file form:

id=XXXXXXXXXXX
key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

As an alternative to creating aws.properties you can use
(with-aws-keys ID KEY ....) but I don't recommended it.

Optional 4. Run "lein test"


## Usage 

I'm trying to keep the test-cases pretty complete, but they might not
be very readable so here is some example usage:


; enqueue the names of all my s3-buckets as a message in queue "bucketlist"
(use '(cljaws core s3 sqs))

(with-aws 
  (with-sqs-queue "bucketlist" 
    (doseq [bucket-name (with-s3 (list-buckets))]
	   (enqueue bucket-name))))


(use '(cljaws sdb helpers))

; create sdb domain
(with-aws (with-sdb (create-domain :workspace)))

; dequeue messages sent above and add each one as a row in the sdb-domain
(with-aws 
  (with-sqs-queue "bucketlist" 
    (with-sdb
	(with-domain :workspace
	  (doseq [msg (take-while (comp not false?) (repeatedly #(dequeue 5)))]
		 (add-attributes msg {:type "testing bucket"}))))))

;select all rows and attibutes from domain
(with-aws (with-sdb (select "* from workspace")))
